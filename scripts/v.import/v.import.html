<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.import</em> imports vector data from files and database connections
supported by the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">OGR</a> library) into the
current location and mapset. If the projection of the input
does not match the projection of the location, the input is reprojected
into the current location. In case that the projection of the input map
does match the projection of the location, the input is imported directly.

<h3>Supported Vector Formats</h3>

<em>v.import</em> uses the OGR library which supports various vector data
formats including <a href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html">ESRI
Shapefile</a>, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_mitab.html">Mapinfo
File</a>, UK .NTF, SDTS, TIGER, IHO S-57 (ENC), DGN, GML, GPX, AVCBin, REC,
Memory, OGDI, and PostgreSQL, depending on the local OGR installation.
For details see the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">OGR web
site</a>. The OGR (Simple Features Library) is part of the
<a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a> library, hence GDAL needs to be
installed to use <em>v.in.ogr</em>.

<p>
The list of actually supported formats can be printed by <b>-f</b> flag.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.import</em> checks the projection metadata of the dataset to be
imported against the current location's projection. If not identical a
related error message is shown.
<br>
To override this projection check (i.e. to use current location's projection)
by assuming that the dataset has the same projection as the current location
the <b>-o</b> flag can be used. This is also useful when geodata to be
imported do not contain any projection metadata at all. The user must be
sure that the projection is identical in order to avoid to introduce data
errors.

<h3>Topology cleaning</h3>

When importing polygons, non-topological polygons are converted to 
topological areas. If the input polygons contain errors (unexpected 
overlapping areas, small gaps between polygons, or warnings about being 
unable to calculate centroids), the import might need to be repeated 
using a <em>snap</em> value as suggested in the output messages.

<!-- TODO: add hints for latlong -->

<p>
The <em>snap</em> threshold defines the maximal distance from one to another
vertex in map units (for latitude-longitude locations in degree). If there
is no other vertex within <em>snap</em> distance, no snapping will be done.
Note that a too large value can severely damage area topology, beyond repair.
<p>
<i>Post-processing:</i> Snapped boundaries may need to be cleaned with
<em>v.clean</em>, using its tools <em>break,rmdupl,rmsa</em>. For details,
refer to the <em>v.clean</em> manual page.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
# import SHAPE file at full extent and reproject to current location projection
v.import input=research_area.shp output=research_area extent=input
</pre></div>
