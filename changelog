grass (5.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Check twice before releasing" release.

  (Federico)

  * Changes to debian/rules as suggested by Markus Neteler:
    + added dh_shlibdeps to generate dependencies
    + --without-blas, --without-lapack: both not needed because the
      module using them was never finished (also removed the Build-deps)
    + --without-dbm: dbm is not used in grass, it is a fake dependency
      (also removed gdbm patch)
    + Markus said:
    
      AFAIK there is no GRASS module which uses that.
      The only existing module was written by me and never submitted, as
      the lapack/blas implementation is still incomplete (someone who left
      the project did it for me). So it's to come thenext ten years...
    
      It's a nice unrequired dependency, nearly as useless as dbm at time
      and for the foreseeable future.

  * manpages are still lost somewhere in time during the install step.
