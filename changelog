grass (5.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes to debian/rules as suggested by Markus Neteler:
    - --without-blas, --without-lapack: both not needed because the
      module using them was never finished (also removed the Build-deps)
    - --without-dbm: dbm is not used in grass, it is a fake dependency
      (also removed gdbm patch)
  * Changed URL in debian/copyright, Baylor was not involved in grass
    development in the last few years and the official home page is
    http://grass.itc.it/
