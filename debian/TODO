Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of
files. They should be automatically classified in the install target and
moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, leaving symlinks so to not
break things.


FIXME:

E: grass-core: package-installs-python-bytecode usr/lib/grass64/etc/.../*.pyc
( -> removed in rules, but still need to generate anew in postinst )
  see /usr/share/debhelper/autoscripts/postinst-python
      /var/lib/dpkg/info/python-numpy.*
      update-python-modules(8)
      dh_python2


grass-core.prerm[.in]:  (adapted from debian/rules)
---------------------
# delete python compiled bytecode files
for DIR in python/grass \
        python/grass/lib \
        python/grass/script \
     do
        rm -f /usr/lib/grass@VERSION@/etc/$DIR/*.pyc
done


grass-gui.prerm[.in]:   (adapted from debian/rules)
--------------------
# delete python compiled bytecode files
for DIR in wxpython \
        wxpython/compat \
        wxpython/gui_modules \
        wxpython/icons ; \
     do
        rm -f /usr/lib/grass@VERSION@/etc/$DIR/*.pyc
done


... but how to do *.postinst with update-python-modules or dh_python2?




* put Tcl/Tk NVIZ back into grass-core so that qgis users can use it?
   (that seems to be a popular use of the qgis-grass toolbox)

TODO:

* allow parallel builds by adding something like this to debian/rules:
{{{
%:
        dh $@ --parallel
}}}



* link Programmers' Manual to a listing in the wxGUI Help menu, if installed?
   (launch using GRASS_HTML_BROWSER)
