Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of
files. They should be automatically classified in the install target and
moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, leaving symlinks so to not
break things.


Package re-org:

Move the programmers' manual out of grass-doc and into a new grass-doc-dev
package, suggested by both grass-dev and grass-doc.
   /usr/share/doc/grass-doc/programming-manual/

Move $GISBASE/etc/gui/ dm/ gm/ gtcltk/ wxpython/ nviz2.2/ v.digit/ form/
into a separate grass-gui package, so that packages like QGIS don't
have to install wxPython etc. as well.

Move remaining contents of the grass binary package into grass-core,
and make the 'grass' binary package a virtual one depending on both
grass-core and grass-gui, and recommending grass-doc.
