Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of files. They should
be automatically classified in the install target and moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, 
leaving symlinks to do not break things.

Current preview version does not build the new wxwidget GUI due to missing non-experimental
support of WxWidget 2.8 and its python bindings. For the same reason python build-deps
are missing.
