Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of
files. They should be automatically classified in the install target and
moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, leaving symlinks so to not
break things.



Package re-org:

[done]
 Move the programmers' manual out of grass-doc and into a new
 grass-doc-dev package, suggested by both grass-dev and grass-doc.
   /usr/share/doc/grass-doc/programming-manual/


[in progress]
 Move $GISBASE/etc/gui/ dm/ gm/ gtcltk/ wxpython/ nviz2.2/ v.digit/ form/
 into a separate grass-gui package, so that packages like QGIS don't
 have to install wxPython etc. as well.
 .
 Move remaining contents of the grass binary package into grass-core,
 and make the 'grass' binary package a virtual one depending on both
 grass-core and grass-gui, and recommending grass-doc.



FIXME:

E: grass-core: package-installs-python-bytecode usr/lib/grass64/etc/python/grass/lib/*.pyc
( -> remove in prerm, generate anew in postinst )


grass-core.install gets $GISBASE/etc/, but how to exclude the 8 grass-gui
dirs from that without explicitly listsing in grass-core.install the other
78 (or so) files in $GISBASE/etc/?


Make use of upstream's gui/icons/grass.desktop file (include it in the
grass-core package as it will launch the text-only version too), but
perhaps we need to patch the Exec= line and or filename with @VERSION@
to follow the other .in files?
.
Currently we ignore upstream's grass.menu file, Debian pkging's version
is @VERSION@.in compliant. Suggest we continue to do so.
