Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of
files. They should be automatically classified in the install target and
moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, leaving symlinks so to not
break things.


FIXME:

E: grass-core: package-installs-python-bytecode usr/lib/grass64/etc/.../*.pyc
( -> removed in rules, but still need to generate anew in postinst )
  see /usr/share/debhelper/autoscripts/postinst-python
      /var/lib/dpkg/info/python-numpy.*
      update-python-modules(8)
