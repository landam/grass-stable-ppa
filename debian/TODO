TODO:
=====

* The grass 'etc' directory contains a mixed arch/non-arch depending mess of
  files. They should be automatically classified in the install target and
  moved to /var/lib/grass or /usr/lib/grass, leaving symlinks so to not
  break things.


* Allow parallel builds by adding something like this to debian/rules:
{{{
%:
        dh $@ --parallel
}}}


* Put Tcl/Tk NVIZ back into grass-core so that qgis users can use it?
   (that seems to be a popular use of the qgis-grass toolbox)
    ... but that makes grass-core depend on Tcl/Tk deps.
  Or to split it off into a new grass-nviz package?
    ... but that adds to the clutter.
  ?


* link Programmers' Manual to a listing in the wxGUI Help menu, if installed?
   (launch using GRASS_HTML_BROWSER)
