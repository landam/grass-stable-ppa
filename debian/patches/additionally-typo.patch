 The resulting linear equation system <i>Ax = b</i> can be solved with several solvers.
 Several iterative solvers with unsymmetric sparse and quadratic matrices support are implemented.

 only work with quadratic matrices, so be careful using them with large maps 
 (maps of size 10.000 cells will need more than one gigabyte of ram).
 Always prefer a sparse matrix solver.
